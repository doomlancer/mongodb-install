# mongodb-install
Script for installing MongoDB on your Linux

--------------------------------

This script is nothing more than a guide, which helps install MongoDB. For example to install it via SSH on a Raspberry Pi.
Of course, other Debian-based Linux OS work as well.

--------------------------------

# What you need
1) A Debian-based Linux OS like Ubuntu, Raspbian, SteamOS or Xubuntu/Kubuntu. See a full list here: http://distrowatch.com/search.php?basedon=Debian

2) Admin rights on the OS.

--------------------------------

# To install, follow these steps
1) Download the "MongoDB-install.sh" to a directory of your choice. I would recommend the home directory.

2) Type "sudo chmod u+x MongoDB-install.sh" in your Terminal.

3) Open the Script with a text editor, e.g. "nano" and type "sudo nano MongoDB-install.sh". Then configure the directory paths for your own usage, in case you want to run the script from somewhere else than the home directory.

4) Then run the Script with "./MongoDB-install.sh"
